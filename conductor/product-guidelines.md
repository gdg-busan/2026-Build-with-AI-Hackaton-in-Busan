# Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Energetic & Hype**: The application should feel exciting and enthusiastic, hyping up the event. Use exclamation marks and strong verbs.
- **Example**: Instead of "Vote submitted", use "Vote LOCKED IN! 🚀".

## Visual Language
- **Immersive Terminal**: The UI should heavily utilize scanlines, glow effects, and monospaced fonts (JetBrains Mono).
- **Aesthetic**: Think "Living Terminal" - like a high-tech dashboard from a sci-fi movie.
- **Palette**: Use `#0A0E1A` (Background), `#00FF88` (Terminal Green), `#4DAFFF` (AI Blue), `#FF6B35` (Accent Orange).

## User Experience (UX)
- **Primary Goal**: **Immersion**. Prioritize animations, reveal effects, and making the user feel like a hacker.
- **Interactions**: Every click should feel significant. Use sound effects or visual feedback for interactions.
- **Transitions**: Smooth, cinematic transitions between pages (e.g., slide-ins, fade-outs).

## Accessibility
- While maximizing immersion, ensure core actions (Voting) remain accessible and distinguishable. High contrast text where possible.
